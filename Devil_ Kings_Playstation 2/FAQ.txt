<b>Why this game?</b>

Because I apparently only make Musou games...  And I like making Musou games, and this isn't a musou game... Clearly I screwed up. 

(It's a pretty fun game, though a bit repetitive that way I made it)

<b>Who are these characters?</b>

Check the Level 20 achievements, that's the real names.

<b>Wait Itsuki? Xavi? Kasuga?  Who are THESE people?</b>

So many people don't know this but there was only 20 people alive during the Warring States Time Period, and so Sengoku Basara ran out of real people and had to make up their own.... 

In all seriousness, this is one of the stupidiest things ever, they just made up three characters... IN THE JAPANESE VERSION, where they SHOULD care about these people.  They didn't even't even call Kasugi "Kunoichi"...  Like that's not a great name and yet they just made up a character instead of just calling her that? 

Yeah It's stupid. But then again you're walking around with robots, Bazookas, grenade launcher plasma attacks.  I guess expecting realism is a bit much.... and yet thhis is based on the REAL people who lived back then for 90 percent of the cast.  Sorry, this shouldn't be a big thing, but it's just so strange. 

<b>X is too hard or too grindy</b>

I'll be honest I'm PRETTY sure everything here can be beaten.  But as people who have played my Samurai Warriors set know, I don't care if something is near impossible, as long as it's possible.  I like having a few hard challenges, and games like this with leveling and such suck for balance... 

If after three months people the community can't accomplish something I might revisit this.   (Or if someone can just prove it is broken)   But I fully believe everything is possible. 

<b>Where's X character?</b> 

So interesting fact, when hacking into this game, I found Reaper, Bramble, Zaan, and Lark as playable characters.  But they don't appear to be finished (I was considering making a patch but if they don't work I'm not going to bother).   ALso Orwik might be playable, but he actually crashes the game. 

<b>Why not .... <Some other Sengoku Basara game>?</b>  

This is in English.  

<b>But Wii version is...</b>

Patience grasshopper.  Wii isn't out yet, but yeah, I'd rather that.  Plus I think there's someone else who wants to do that. 

<b>I don't like the icon/badge/something else.</b>

Reach out to me and I'll give you full credit for any improvement.  I won't guarentee I'll accept it, but honestly I hate making badges so I doubt you can do much worse. 

<b>Why is this game so bad?</b>

This is a question that Copilot kept trying to put in the FAQ... so I put it in.  Honestly, I don't think it's that bad, overall but it's just VERY VERY VERY repetitive.   Kind of why I expect you to be able to hit 90 on all 4 items. 

<b>Don't heal is a bad achievement because.... </b>

Nah, it's 10 points because it's challenging.  You probably shouldn't try to kill everything in the level, because some enemies will drop healing items.   Yeah it's not intended to be easy. 

<b>Why not give every character level 20 achievements?</b>

Originally the level 5 was level 10 and the level 10 were level 20... but after thinking I think they're just grinding achievements for grinding achievements.  Maybe I should have done 15, but I didn't... 

<b> What about Deadwood Counteroffensive and the calvery achievements?</b>

Honestly, it failed one time, and it was a one-off, so I killed the achievements.  I have an idea how it should work, but it definitely doesn't always work. 

<b>You're spoiling the Secrets!</b>

You're spoiling the spoiling!   (Honestly I didn't want people to grind unnecessarily) 

<b>Collecting all the items is grindy</b>

Deal with it.
