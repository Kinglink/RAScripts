[b]Any Call outs?[/b]

Yes, the reason we have individual stage achievements is DaleRedfield (And additional icons).  The Icon was made by Raiichi, total praise to both of them.

[b]Why did you make this set?[/b]

Always was planning to make the Xtreme Legends set but for what ever reason never got around to it. 

[b]Ok but why did you split these up?[/b]  

Laziness... well kind of.  I also fundamentally think unlocking characters is the best part of DW 3.  So I wanted to allow that. 

Plus using items and weapons you can get in DW 5 would trivialize DW 3.   Just doesn't make sense to allow XL with the base games.  (Yes that means I have opinions on the others.)

[b]What do I need to start this set?[/b]

I would say beat the DW 3 base set... try to master it, when you're completely done (At least maxed the characters, and the items as much as you plan to) Then import that save. 

As to how to import that save.... it depends on how you have PCSX2 set up.   I use folders, so I had to copy the save file between the two. 

Also you should have a DW 3 iso, I can't give you that, or help you with that, but to unlock a majority of the characters you will need the original game.   

I looked into patching that out, it didn't seem as easy as DW 5 so... yeah sorry.  It's annoying I know. 

[b]What is the game's difficulty level?[/b]  

This game is harder than most Dynasty Warriors games, except maybe Dynasty Warriors 2 for obvious reasons. But it's challenging but doable. 

Normal mode is quite hard with a level zero character, so leveling up is crucial.    

[b]Why do you allow Novice Mode?[/b]

I have a fundamental belief that if you beat a game no matter the difficulty, you should earn a "Beaten" This is something I feel strongly about. 

All limiting it to Normal mode would do is get people to download a save (which is against the rules) or run through the game a second time... Meh.   Enjoy the game your way.  I'll challenge you later. 

[b]Why is everyone required to do very hard?[/b]

Because the game added Very Hard for all characters... 

[b]Why can't I earn hard mode and Very hard Musou Mode in free mode?[/b]

Laziness...  Also just play through their story mode.  If you do something really stupid, just beat up to that level in Novice...  

PS. I noticed in Novice bosses still felt like they had a decent amount of HP even with maxed characters?  *shrug* 

[b]Anything Missable?[/b]  

No... unless you play two players.  The game does lock out the second player. And some items (Red items and Fifth weapons) are only earnable 1 time.  I'm not marking them as missable, but... well they technically are.  Just don't play 2 player. 

[b]Where are the challenges for challenge modes?[/b]  

There are already red items for challenge mode. The logic for Iron Man mode is complex, so I just went with a red item a piece instead.  No leaderboards for similar reasons. 

[b]How do I item break?[/b]  

While there's a guide on GameFAQs, it's complex and involved I think.  Basically combo, a lot.  It's beyond my current ability, but practicing with the combo challenge is recommended by the guide.  Good luck.   Maybe it's a total myth (it's almost certainly not) 

[b]Is the third outfit a little too hard to get?[/b]

Lu Bu is a special stage, so of course it's going to be here.   SSX I'll be honest, I see it unlocking I haven't earned it myself.  Good luck with that one.

[b]Zhuge Liang/Sima Yi are terrible[/b]

That's the fun of this set and making you play every character.  Hey at least it's not SW XL 5th weapon on Chaos only hard...    Also abuse the saves. 

[b]I have a good idea for a measure or trigger! [/b] 

Let me know I think I got most of them but I'm sure there's more.[/b]

[b]How should I do the subset?[/b]

If you are going for item breaks ever save your game before the final boss.  If you get a Max level Item, switch to the subset with that continue and beat the boss again, you should have the SAME item (item drop is decided on pick up)  

Do NOT save after the boss or you'll kill your in-game save.
