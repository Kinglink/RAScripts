[b]This set kind of sucks.[/b]

*Takes a swig of beer*  This game kind of sucks.... 

Ok it doesn't... I mean it does.. but I liked the game at one point.   It's not complex, but you throw on the infinite lives code and you get a ... 

It's bad. 

[b]No, I'm talking about the achievements.[/b]

So a long long time ago this site got NES achievements.  

It's been a long long long time.  No one Devved this game.  I don't fault people, it's a hard game to work on, I didn't see a room id (I'm sure there's one somewhere but maybe not).  It's a simple game, and really... basic. 

So yeah... either I made this set, or the game goes undeved.

[b]"But I'd dev it"[/b] 

Do it.  This is WIDE open to someone else coming in and adding to this and making it a better set.  You have more than my blessing.   I'll even help to dig ram if you need.   But I wanted this game to have a set. 

[b]No death Achievements are whack[/b]

Would you prefer no damage achievements?  Ok then hush.  We needed 6 achievements, you got 7.  Be happy. 

Also they suck in this game.

[b]Any other info?[/b]

I literally had to watch Hudson Hawk to come up with titles for these achievements.   I demand hazard pay.
