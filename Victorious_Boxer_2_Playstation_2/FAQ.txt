<b>Wait what's that?</b>

Achievement trailer. 

<b>So what's up with the UI?</b>

I knew you'd ask that.  There is none.   This is pure boxing, you and the opponent just pummeling each other. 

<b> So how do I know when the opponent is going to get knocked out of if I'm winded? </b>

Play the game more and you'll get a feel for it. If you need it for an achievement spam the same attack, or weaken him up with the jab. 

So the real story is there's a HP value for your opponent it appears to never go up in a round, but does recover between rounds (not fully).  While playing this I've seen you mostly can't get a Knock Down with the Jab (mostly) so soften up opponents with that.

<b> These required punches seem odd.</b>  

They're all based on the manga, every single one is either based on something that happened in the manga, or because the character's not seen finishing the match/losing the match I just made something up. 

I made this set more for super fans, but anyone should be able to get play through and enjoy this set. 

Read the manga, you'll enjoy it, then you'll understand why Takamura only throws Lefts in a fight.

<b> X is really hard</b> 

I'll be honest some of these are very hard, but I have gotten the Takamura Vs the Bear Legit, the first rounder as well as the No knockdowns.  Frog Punch is possible (It barely hits) and I think everything else is pretty doable.   

I will say I think the hardest will be the TKO, but let's see what the results show. 

<b>Why didn't you make this more like the manga</b> 

Why didn't the devs?   I mean honestly there's so many awesome iconic battles I wanted to include, or special things.  Imagine destroying the bloody cross from Arnie... except I don't think Arnie really does the bloody cross, at least not in a predicatable way.  Sadly the "canon" matches are just who they are and maybe a couple moves.  In general, the bouts are kind of like "What ever". 

<b> Wait Kamogawa can't do Iron Fist/Tekken all of a sudden</b>

So story reason is that he breaks his fist when he throws the punch.   In the game, you can throw 5 of them, after 5 you no longer throw that special punch.   Again this game does such a poor job of explaining the systems or even talking about what's going on in the matches, you just need to be an uber fan to know. 

<b> Will you do another?</b>

Game, definitely, unless I don't. 

Anime Game,  most likely.

Hajime no Ippo game,  honestly this is my favorite series but I have no desire to make a set for create your own character now.  Haven't looked at Hajime No Ippo 2, but this is the best one out.    I will say I'm eying Hajime No Ippo 3 for the Ps3 but I haven't played it.   When Ps3 gets support, I will heavily consider that one, but there's a few Ps3 games I have to cover.
