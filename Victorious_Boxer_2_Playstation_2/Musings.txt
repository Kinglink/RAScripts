Miyata beats Ryo Mashiba? 

Need to get round numbers 

100 percent efficiency?) 



In the Comic it was 1:30 in the first... but that might be too fast.

Punches after a down?

Start Act 1 
Miyata vs Ippo   4th round upper cut.  (Right hook Special JOfre Uppercut) 
Ippo vs Naoya Ogawa   Nothing interesting.  First round?  No personal knock downs. 
Ippo vs Yusuke Oda  3rd round   Jabs?   Jabs don't do knock down NO Downs? 
Ippo vs Yoshio Fujiwara,  Uppercut after headbut but we can't do that.
Ippo vs Jason Ozuma, 2nd round.  Ippo Ducks under hooks, and 4 hit combo, but can't really do that.     Don't use Jofre
Ippo Vs Kenta Kobashi 4th round.  Maybe "upper" 
NOTE Missing 2 matches here. 
Ippo vs Ruichi Hayami 1st round? Body Blow?  Jofre Upper cut (Right Hook Special) 
Ippo vs Ryo Mashiba 3rd round Take him down with a hook then a straight .  (or a straight that lands as he's going down.)   (neeed to check which of each) 
ippo vs Takeshi Sendo 4th Round at least. (he can't get up after the third)   Beat him with a deadly smash (Right straight special) 
Kimura vs Shinji Kanzaki  Beat the manga.  10 rounds?   Slow Mo? 
Aoki vs Armand Garcia  Beat the manga?  7th round?   Maybe use either corkscrew or double pounch (either right straight or left straight special ) 
NOTE 1 missing bout
Ippo vs Keigo Okita 1st round knock out.   
Miyata spar with Papyo Practice Jolt!
Miyata vs Jimmy Sisfa  4th round beat with Jolt. 
Ippo Vs Takuma Saeki 4th round right upper. Or Jofre Upper
Kimura Vs Nishimura Hiroshi.  This is a decision fight?  5th or 6th round?

Ippo Alexander Volg Zangief.  5th round Gazelle Punch
Ippo Vs Eiji Date.  Reach Round 5. 

End Act 1 

Takeshi Sendo vs Alexander Volg Zangief.  Ended in decisions?  Late round smash? 
Miyata vs Lee Chongbil (Sp?).  3rd round.  Countered . (Jolt Counter?) 
Aoki Vs Snake Thomas  1st Round Right hook
Kimura vs Pone Morocotte  Nothing special?  Slow Battle?
Ippo vs  Ponchai Chuwatana.  2nd round Dempsey Roll
Takumura vs Bear!   Nothing?  Maybe time?  60 seconds
Takamura vs Takaaki Itō  Beat only using Jabs (left jabs?) and left straights
Sendo vs Akira Shigeta 3rd Round Deadly smash (Alternate arm) 
Aoki vs Ippo Spar  Hit with all three moves? 
Ippo Vs Sendo Seventh round Dempsey Roll. 
Kimura vs Miyata  PRactice Dragon Fish punch (Left hook)  3 landed
Kimura vs Ryo Mashiba Dragon Fish Punch  (What should have been. ) 

End Act 2

Miyata vs Arnie Jolt 
Ippo vs Hammer Nao  Upper cut, or Jofre upper cut
Tatsuya vs Armand Allegaria  This is a missed fight that goes to decision?   I don't know?  Maybe nothing?  Dragon fish?    Slow mo Dragon Fish? 
Takamura vs Morris West Right Straight.  Technically a ring out. 
Ippo Vs Yi Yonsu  DEMPSEY ROLL again... guh. 
TAkamura Vs Bryan Hawk Right straight 

End Act 3 

Jinpachi Nekota vs Dankichi Hama   Never shown in manga. 
Genji Kamogawa vs Jinpachi Nekota Shown but not official fight. 
Genji Kamogawa vs Ralph Anderson  Iron Fist!!!! (Tekken)  (this shit is so powerful.)  (limited number?) 

End Act 4

<stopped looking at number of bout here> 

Ippo vs Iwao Shimabukuro Right Hook or Dempsey roll.  (looks like a Right hook, book call is Dempsey)  (They look so small, they should be over built) 
Aoki Vs Katsutake Imae  (Must have a look away)  All four moves? 
(have a reverse fight? For the "Lore accurate")  Though the lore accurate is a "Draw" so... maybe not? 
(All*stars password) 

End Act 5

Takamura vs Rally Bernard (Look away, doesn't have to have the opponent work (0xa not 0x82))  Finish with right straights. (Only right straights?)   (1 Round? Would be fast)
Volg vs Ippo Spar OH MY GOD YOU PLAY AS VOLG!  WHITE FANG HIS ASS! (Technically Volg is supposed to destroy it.)   Right upper.
Ippo vs Ryūhei Sawamura Dempsey ROLL!!!!!!
Tatsuya vs Eleki Battery (in the book it's a draw.  But if we do more body blows (uppers) he should drop easily. ) (guy drops easily) 
Aoki vs Papaya Dachiu (Another draw?  Fuck that... Get in there and upper him as well) 
Miyata vs Medgern Datchboy (Should be Cross Counter.  Jolt his ass)
Takamura vs David Golden Eagle  Hard to choose.  Slow mo?  left or right straight?   Basically in the manga he's blind at this point. 
Itagaki vs Fumito Makino (Fast right hook (Almost a counter)
Ippo vs Takuzo Karasawa (No dempsey rollin the special moves, so don't have to seal that. ) Win with a left hook)
Itagaki vs Imai   (Slow mo?   There's no official )
Ippo vs Keiichi Take (Right hook since we can't do the ducking punch well)
Miyata vs Che Jounbong (Technically down on the right hook, and killed with the left.  let them do either.) 
Ippo vs Ichiro Miyata. (Yeah this didn't happen.  But it's what EVERYONE wants.  All four moves Ippo)

Mode Selector?  Whose' fighting in other modes? 

Get Time and Round count?  (Time probably counts donw)_ 

Leaderboard punches.   Leaderboard speed in each match  and speed on Hard. 

Leaderboard 

"Why isn't it more accurate" because the opponents are not accurate.  Arnie would only throw left punches.  Also Jolts have maximum power even when the opponent is not attacking. 

Momentary battle MIGHT invalidate the 

More than 3 downs in a round?  (Hawk fight and Jinpachi vs dankichi seems to count)

How to tell what mode? 

Should we do a special move per character? 



Perfect bouts?

What does it feel like to be strong?
