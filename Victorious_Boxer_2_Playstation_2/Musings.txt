<stopped looking at number of bout here> 

Ippo vs Iwao Shimabukuro Right Hook or Dempsey roll.  (looks like a Right hook, book call is Dempsey)  (They look so small, they should be over built) 
Aoki Vs Katsutake Imae  (Must have a look away)  All four moves? 
(have a reverse fight? For the "Lore accurate")  Though the law accurate is a "Draw" so... maybe not? 
(All*stars password)

Ippo vs Ryūhei Sawamura Dempsey ROLL!!!!!!
Tatsuya vs Eleki Battery (in the book it's a draw.  But if we do more body blows (uppers) he should drop easily. ) (guy drops easily) 
Aoki vs Papaya Dachiu (Another draw?  Fuck that... Get in there and upper him as well) 
Miyata vs Medgern Datchboy (Should be Cross Counter.  Jolt his ass)
Takamura vs David Golden Eagle  Hard to choose.  Slow mo?  left or right straight?   Basically in the manga he's blind at this point. 
Itagaki vs Fumito Makino (Fast right hook (Almost a counter)
Ippo vs Takuzo Karasawa (No dempsey rollin the special moves, so don't have to seal that. ) Win with a left hook)
Itagaki vs Imai   (Slow mo?   There's no official )

Eiji Date beating Ippo in the 5th? 


Mode Selector?  Whose' fighting in other modes? 

Get Time and Round count?  (Time probably counts donw)_ 

Leaderboard punches.   Leaderboard speed in each match  and speed on Hard. 

Leaderboard 

"Why isn't it more accurate" because the opponents are not accurate.  Arnie would only throw left punches.  Also Jolts have maximum power even when the opponent is not attacking. 

Momentary battle MIGHT invalidate the 

More than 3 downs in a round?  (Hawk fight and Jinpachi vs dankichi seems to count)

How to tell what mode? 

Should we do a special move per character? 



Perfect bouts?

What does it feel like to be strong?
