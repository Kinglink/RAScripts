So you can't change the difficulty in the middle of a run but save cheating is much easier because of that.. so !@#$ it.  Every stage will get an achievement

This game is rather sparse.  Not even fourth weapons. 

Only 17 Musou modes. (might be 23)  But 41 characters.  Each character to 25?  Maybe

Challenge modes? Sure.. Just simple "Beat the top score" 

Beat each level on Chaos. 



CHaos is hard.  I've requested subsets for colleting horses, and Chaos mode.  Also maybe 100 percenting each character.
